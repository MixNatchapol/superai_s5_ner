# Name Entity Recognition Hackathon from Super AI Engineer season 5

This is the code for the hackathon of super ai engineer season 5 in the problem of Name Entity Recognition from modified lst20 dataset with the a little help (actually its also everything) of LLM (Chatgpt)

Hi, This is Natchapol Lebkrut. Despite the fact that I submitted the result 33 mins late, I acheive the best as as 0.79084 which passes the baseline.

The approach that I use is converting the raw dataset into the form of sentence_id and tokens where it will be train grouped_by the sentence_id and trained in batch.
